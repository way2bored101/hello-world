3.8.17

Woke up feeling awful. I thought hospitals were supposed to make you better, but I only got worse in there. I couldn't stop 
thinking about it, couldn't stop crying, couldn't force my mind to be positive. I was getting worse every minute and I had 
gotten to the point where I didn't want to reach out for help anymore. That's how I knew it was getting really bad. I imagined 
giving up and just letting it end like this. I even thought about leaving a note that said, thank you mental system for making 
me feel so insecure that you've taken away my will to live. I haven't had thoughts like this in over 3 years. Yet somehow 
they've brought me back. 

I didn't want to cry anymore; my eyes had become bloodshot and my nose required snot drainings every couple of moments. I 
walked from the bathroom back to my bedroom. I picked up my phone and texted my boyfriend, 

I just cried for an hr and I dont feel any better. 

The time read 7:01am. He was probably in the shower right now. There was no time for me to talk to him and vent about how much 
I hated the mental system for making me feel like this. But I knew by the time he called back, I needed to find a resolution 
that was good for me and would make him less worried. I got it. I'd eat a banana and go for a jog outside. As stupid as it 
sounds, the more I take care of my physical health, the better I feel mentally. And though the hospital messed with my physical 
and mental health in there, they couldn't mess with it anymore. I needed to make the choice not to let them mess with me 
anymore. 

My boyfriend called back. I told him I'm okay now, I'm going to eat a banana and then go for a jog. Why a banana? Because I'm 
too lazy to make something and bananas are one of the most low maintenance fruits to eat. He chuckled. 

There's a mini beach in my neighborhood. From the sidewalk, it looks like a driveway on the right and grass to sand transition 
on the left. I walked up the driveway and sat down on the cold pavement. I watched the gentle waves crashing against the side 
of the pavement, felt the crazy wind flapping against my jacket, and listened to the music pounding in my ears. It felt good 
to have this moment of solitude, just me, nature, and music. 

Later in the day, I needed some inspiration so I looked up top 15 quotations by Albert Einstein. The one that spoke to me the 
most was this: "Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds". Whether or not I am a great 
spirit is unknown. That being said, I can work hard everyday to become one.
